# Cute Anime Boys (Vencord)

A Vencord plugin to do `/anime-boys ?cat:bool`, and send a random cute anime boy from reddit.

## Fork Changes

Fixed the plugin so it is now compatible with Vencord's current formatting. Before this, it was extremely outdated by like 2 years. The name of the plugin file has been renamed for easier recognition and handling.
